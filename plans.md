# From TOP

1. Application should have at least two routes (I.E. individual Route components that the router picks between)

2. Decide:
    - Component and folder structure
    - How to set up the application
    - Which components/functionalities are needed

3. Have at least the following pages:
    - A homepage
    - A shop page, which includes the shopping cart

4. Let a user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, shown on both routes
    - The 'Router' Lesson of TOP is pertinent to routing (funnily enough): https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-router
    - Assignment 3 in the aforementioned lesson is particular pertinent to the navigation bar, just remember the implementation is an older Router version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Law7wfdg_ls

5. Add a few images or information to the homepage, anything basic

6. On the shopping cart route:
    i) User should see a sticky bar (it can just be a top section) displaying the number of items in the cart
    ii) Have a button next to "it" to go to the cart checkout and pay (NOT to be implemented)

7. Build card items in the SHOP for each product, featuring:
    i) An input for user to select how many items to buy
    ii) A button for incrementing the aforementioned quantity
    ii) A button for decrementing the aforementioned quantity
    iii) A title for each product
    iv) An "Add To Card" button

8. Number of items in the cart should adjust when something is added to the cart

9. Test app thoroughly:
    - Via React Testing Library
    - Don't directly test react-router-dom

# Plan of static version of app

- App component:
    -- Renders a ShoppingCartSite component, passing to it the following props:
        -- An availableItemNames array (containing strings with item names)

- ShoppingCartSite component:
    -- Renders a RouteSwitcher component, passing to it the following props:
        -- props.availableItemNames

- RouteSwitcher component:
    -- Imports Home and Shop
    -- Contains the following array: [Home, Shop]

    -- Renders the following in between BrowserRouter component tags:

        -- A NavigationBar component, passing to it the following props:
            -- displayName of each of components linked to (Home and Shop)

        -- In between Routes component tags:
            -- A Route for the Home component (put Home into this line via the same array element passing Home in props to NavigationBar), passing to it the following props:
                -- websiteType (which in this case will be 'shopping')
                -- The imageSrc for an image (in this case, an image related to shopping)

            -- A Route for the Shop component (put Shop into this line via the same array element passing Home in props to NavigationBar), passing to it the following props:
                -- props.availableItemNames

- NavigationBar component:
    -- Renders a ul element containing, for each displayName in its props:
        -- A li element with this displayName as text content
        -- Links to the corresponding Route (see https://blog.devgenius.io/how-to-create-a-navbar-using-react-router-51b78bc6ce51 for a Router Version 6 example)

- Home component:
    -- Renders a div containing:
        -- A div with the text content 'Welcome to my {props.websiteType} website!'
        -- An img with the src props.imageSrc

- Shop component:
    -- Renders a div containing:
        -- A CartTracker component
        -- An ItemCard component for each element in props.availableItemNames, supplying the corresponding name (itemName) to the ItemCard in props
        -- Add TODO for considering putting the ItemCard components above into some sort of component to group them in

- CartTracker component:
    -- Renders a div containing:
        -- A CartSizeDisplay component
        -- A CheckoutButton component

- CartSizeDisplay component:
    -- Renders a div with text content '{} items in cart!'

- CheckoutButton component:
    -- Renders a button with text content 'Pay'

- ItemCard component:
    -- Renders a div containing:
        -- Text content of '{props.itemName}'
        -- Rendered QuantityInput component
        -- Rendered QuantityIncrementer component
        -- Render QuantityDecrementer component

- QuantityInput component:
    -- Renders a div containing:
        -- A label element with a htmlFor of the same ID generated for the input below
        -- An input of type number with a min of 0 and steps of 1 and a default initial value (later to be replaced by state) and an ID generated by uniqid

- QuantityIncrementer component:
    -- Renders a button containing '+' as text content

- QuantityDecrementer component:
    -- Renders a button containing '-' as text content
