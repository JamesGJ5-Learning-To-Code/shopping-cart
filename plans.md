# From TOP

1. Application should have at least two routes (I.E. individual Route components that the router picks between)

2. Decide:
    - Component and folder structure
    - How to set up the application
    - Which components/functionalities are needed

3. Have at least the following pages:
    - A homepage
    - A shop page, which includes the shopping cart

4. Let a user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, shown on both routes
    - The 'Router' Lesson of TOP is pertinent to routing (funnily enough): https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-router
    - Assignment 3 in the aforementioned lesson is particular pertinent to the navigation bar, just remember the implementation is an older Router version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Law7wfdg_ls

5. Add a few images or information to the homepage, anything basic

6. On the shopping cart route:
    i) User should see a sticky bar (it can just be a top section) displaying the number of items in the cart
    ii) Have a button next to "it" to go to the cart checkout and pay (NOT to be implemented)

7. Build card items in the SHOP for each product, featuring:
    i) An input for user to select how many items to buy
    ii) A button for incrementing the aforementioned quantity
    ii) A button for decrementing the aforementioned quantity
    iii) A title for each product
    iv) An "Add To Card" button

8. Number of items in the cart should adjust when something is added to the cart

9. Test app thoroughly:
    - Via React Testing Library
    - Don't directly test react-router-dom

# Plan of static version of app

- App component:
    -- DONE Renders a ShoppingCartSite component, passing to it the following props:
        -- An availableItemNames array (containing strings with item names)

- ShoppingCartSite component:
    -- DONE Renders a RouteSwitcher component, passing to it the following props:
        -- props.availableItemNames

- RouteSwitcher component:
    -- DONE Imports Home and Shop

    -- DONE Renders the following in between BrowserRouter component tags:

        -- A NavigationBar component, passing to it the following props:
            -- path strings array, ['home', 'shop']

        -- In between Routes component tags:
            -- DONE A Route for the Home component, passing to it the following props:
                -- websiteType (which in this case will be 'shopping')
                -- The imageSrc for an image (in this case, an image related to shopping)

            -- DONE A Route for the Shop component, passing to it the following props:
                -- props.availableItemNames

    -- DONE Add TODO re: passing to navigationBar and the Routes similar information, adn so passing from same object literal to avoid, essentially, repeating code

- NavigationBar component:
    -- DONE Renders a ul element containing, for each displayName in its props:
        -- A li element with this displayName as text content
        -- Links to the corresponding Route (see https://blog.devgenius.io/how-to-create-a-navbar-using-react-router-51b78bc6ce51 for a Router Version 6 example)

- Home component:
    -- DONE Renders a div containing:
        -- A div with the text content 'Welcome to my {props.websiteType} website!'
        -- An img with the src props.imageSrc

- Shop component:
    -- Renders a div containing:
        -- DONE A CartTracker component
        -- DONE An ItemList component, passing to it props.availableItemNames

- CartTracker component:
    -- DONE Renders a div containing:
        -- DONE A CartSizeDisplay component
        -- DONE A CheckoutButton component

- CartSizeDisplay component:
    -- DONE Renders a div with text content '{} items in cart!'

- CheckoutButton component:
    -- DONE Renders a button with text content 'Pay'

- ItemList component:
    -- Renders, in a div:
        -- DONE An ItemCard component for each element in props.availableItemNames, supplying the corresponding name (itemName) to the ItemCard in props


- ItemCard component:
    -- Renders a div containing:
        -- DONE Text content of '{props.itemName}'
        -- DONE Rendered QuantityInput component

- QuantityInput component:
    -- Renders a div containing:
        -- DONE A label element with a htmlFor of the same ID generated for the input below
        -- DONE An input of type number with a min of 0 and steps of 1 and a default initial value (later to be replaced by state) and an ID generated by uniqid

# Plan of interactive version of app

States:

    - allQuantitiesChosen:
        Affects:
            - Text content of CartSizeDisplay (the sum of allQuantitiesChosen should be included in the text content)
            - Value of corresponding input in QuantityInput (this input is linked to via the index in allQuantitiesChosen being the key of the QuantityInput's parent ItemCard)
        Affected by:
            - Changing value of input in QuantityInput (should deep-copy allQuantitiesChosen, change the element at the correct index of the deep copy, then update allQuantitiesChosen using setAllQuantitiesChosen)

Step-by-step plan:

1. DONE In App, change availableItemNames to availableItems, which will be an array containing, for each item, an object literal featuring a key-value pair for the item's name (a string)
2. DONE Make the rest of the src directory consistent with the aforementioned new format

3. DONE In App, to each object literal in availableItems, add a key-value pair for initialQuantityChosen

4. In Shop, map initialQuantityChosen from each item object in availableItems to its corresponding index in a new array allInitialQuantitiesChosen
5. In Shop, initialize state of allQuantitiesChosen (as allInitialQuantitiesChosen) and setAllQuantitiesChosen, with the assistance of useState

6. In Shop, get sum of allQuantitiesChosen (call it cartSize) via the array's reduce method
7. Pass cartSize down to CartSizeDisplay via props
8. Render cartSize in CartSizeDisplay's text content

9. In Shop, map availableItems to an array of availableItemNames and pass it to ItemList via props

10. Pass allQuantitiesChosen from Shop to ItemList via props
11. Pass setAllQuantitiesChosen from Shop to QuantityInput via props

12. Pass each item's name in availableItemNames from ItemList to each ItemCard via props
13. Pass an item's corresponding quantityChosen in allQuantitiesChosen from the ItemList down to the QuantityInput via props

14. In QuantityInput, set the input's value to quantityChosen

15. From ItemList, pass indexOfQuantityChosen (index of a certain ItemCard's quantityChosen in allQuantitiesChosen) down to QuantityInput in a prop called allQuantitiesChosenIndex

16. In QuantityInput, write a method modifyQuantityChosenInState that uses setAllQuantitiesChosen and takes the current state and copies it and modifies the value at the index yielded by allQuantitiesChosenIndex to the new value of the target of the event passed to this method

17. Give the input modifyQuantityChosenInState as its onChange callback

18. Pass setCartSize from Shop down to QuantityInput via props
